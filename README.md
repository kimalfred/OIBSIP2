Java Swing for GUI: I created a user-friendly and intuitive interface using Java Swing, much like the Online Reservation System. Making the UI resemble a real ATM's familiarity was the difficult part of this project. 

Database-Driven Transactions: I connected MySQL databases to manage transactions rather than using a stand-alone transaction system. This strengthened and secured the procedure in addition to streamlining it. The system performed transactions precisely, from handling balance inquiries to enabling cash withdrawals.
